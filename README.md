# Bookcase

A collection of CAD files for the design of a bookshelf. The bookshelf itself is made by: (1) repurposing an Ikea Elvirla frame, (2) custom CNC routing wood for wooden shelves, (3) adding aluminum to create an edge/lip for each shelf.

The bookshelf has 4 shelves, and a base which will created from a thicker wood.
